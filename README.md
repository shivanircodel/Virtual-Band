# Virtual-Band

## Inspiration

As fellow musicians and hackers, we were inspired to make a mini virtual band with different instruments that people can use as backup in case they donâ€™t know how to actually play one of the instruments.

## What it does

The website consists of seven different instruments that users can play on. The seven instruments are the piano, guitar, drums, violin, flute, trumpet and xylophone. The website also has a twilio feature which asks the user which instrument they would want to play and uses Coachroach Db for a coinbase.

## How we built it

We built both the front and back end in repl.it and while the front end was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, the back end was made using Python. We made a chat and call in feature using Twlio and Coachroach DB for having a coinbase, the more you use the instruments, the more coins you receive.

## Challenges we ran into

The instruments were definitely the most challenging part of our website. We originally wanted to implement violin and flute into our website but we were having trouble with it and so we decided to scrap it and make bongos and a karaoke machine instead. Also two of us live in the US and two live in India so it was a bit difficult communicating with the major time zone differences. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we were able to build and up and working website within 48 hours despite two of us having school on the first day it started so not being able to work on it in the beginning and balancing this with our busy high school/college work. We also learnt a lot of things from this Hackathon and enjoyed working together and being able to work well together despite just forming our team this week.

## What we learned

Shivani learnt how to make javascript instruments and Utsav completely learnt how to use Cockroach DB in this Hackathon.
